1] The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.
2] format()

first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
print(full_name)

# To insert a variableâ€™s value into a string, place the letter f immediately before the opening quotation mark
# These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value.

3] Python can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a string. To ensure that no whitespace exists at the right end of a string, use
the strip() method.
